> ***Abstract:*** Electroencephalography (EEG) based emotion recognition has become a subtle research area because of its promising applications. An effective emotion recognition relies on significant and stable features. In this paper, we propose an EEG based emotion recognition method- ology based on a hybrid feature extraction combined with Genetic Al- gorithm (GA) based feature selection. The features are extracted from three domains: time, frequency and discrete wavelet The proposal is eval- uated on DEAP dataset where the emotional states are classified using a GA optimized Multi-Layer Perceptron. The proposed model identifies a. two classes of emotions viz. Low/High Valence with an average accuracy of 95.96% and Low/High Arousal with an average accuracy of 95.39%, b. four classes of emotions viz. High Valence-Low Arousal, High Valence-High Arousal, Low Valence-Low Arousal and Low Valence-High Arousal with 91.88% accuracy, which are better compared to the existing results reported in the literature.<br/>
